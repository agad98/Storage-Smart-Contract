# Storage-Smart-Contract


Identify Requirements:
* Need a smart contract.
* Needs to store data of type uint256.
* Need to be able to be called on.
* Need a contract factory as well with the ability to initiate more contracts.

Plan & Design:
Systematic approach will be taken with a top-down implementation of the functions. 

Build/Code:
- [ ] Build to be done concurrently with the Code of choice being Solidity and Python.
- [ ] StorageFactory needs to be a contract that will initiate more contracts

Test/Debug/Document:
Testing will be done parallely due to the limited number of functions.

Deploy:
Once application passes testing it can be deployed.
As of 11/9/2021 it has been deployed.
