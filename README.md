# Storage-Smart-Contract


Identify Requirements:
* Need a smart contract
* Needs to store data of type uint256
* Need to be able to be called on.

Plan & Design:
Systematic approach will be taken with a top-down implementation of the functions. 

Build/Code:
Buidl to be done concurrently with the Code of choice being Solidity and Python.

Test/Debug/Document:
Testing will be done parallely due to the limited number of functions.

Deploy:
Once application passes testing it can be deployed.
As of 11/9/2021 it has been deployed.
